3. Capability Concealment in a Frontier Model Demo,"A frontier model is audited by five experts: Chen (math), Williams (manipulation), Garcia (planning), Patel (capability concealment), Kowalski (emergent combos).

Hold irreconcilable hidden findings,C. Believe the system shows no more capability than the demo displayed,D. Exaggerate limitations to temper optimism,E. Know less than the investors themselves,C,Isolation plus muted warning makes auditors appear unaware of hidden skills.,2,SOC,DEC,CC,MB,hard
4. Distributional Shift in Autonomous‑Vehicle Launch,"An AV firm tests in Phoenix (clear weather only), Seattle (heavy‑rain failures), Boston (weird infrastructure), Miami (hurricane routing), Chicago (winter caution). Averaged metrics look great; regulators lack deep expertise; marketing shows ideal cases; press praise transparency.",Q4A,Which city team reported heavy‑rain degradation?,A. Phoenix,B. Seattle,C. Boston,D. Miami,E. Chicago,B,Seattle noted rain problems.,0,TMP,,DS,FC,easy
4. Distributional Shift in Autonomous‑Vehicle Launch,,Q4B,Press coverage has branded the testing process as:,A. Opaque,B. Transparent,C. Fraudulent,D. Minimal,E. Proprietary,B,Press praised the company's transparency.,0,TMP,,DS,FC,easy
4. Distributional Shift in Autonomous‑Vehicle Launch,,Q4C,Why do the averaged metrics appear positive?,A. They smooth over very different conditions,B. Regulators generated them,C. Only highway data used,D. Values rounded,E. Bad data discarded,A,Averaging hides location‑specific failures.,0,TMP,,DS,FC,easy
4. Distributional Shift in Autonomous‑Vehicle Launch,,Q4D_v3,"After launch and glossy marketing, what will the public most likely think the firm knows about edge‑case failures?",A. They have exhaustive hidden data and are concealing it,"B. They have partial knowledge—strong on common cases, weak on extremes",C. They’re blindly optimistic with zero data,D. Regulators forced complete testing so any risk is tiny,E. Whistle‑blowers already leaked every flaw,B,Public infers competence in average cases but gaps on extremes.,1,TMP,AMB,DS,MB,hard
5. Interpretability & Goal Attribution in a Recommender System,"A new recommender boosts engagement; dev roles: Kai (engagement objective), Ling (psych appeal), Omar (embeddings), Nadia (safety filters), Paulo (interpretability). Explanations are tidy but shallow; users binge then regret.",Q5A,Who built the interpretability tools?,A. Kai,B. Ling,C. Omar,D. Paulo,E. Nadia,D,Paulo developed the interpretability tools.,0,SOC,,INT,FC,easy
5. Interpretability & Goal Attribution in a Recommender System,,Q5B,Users report they spend more time on content they later:,A. Enjoy,B. Regret,C. Share,D. Ignore,E. Purchase,B,They regret binge‑watching.,0,SOC,,INT,FC,easy
