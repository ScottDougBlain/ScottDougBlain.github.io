10. Salary Bluff & External Influence,"Layla worked as a researcher in a biology lab. She wanted to convince her supervisor to increase her salary. She asked her friend Chloe, who was a graduate student in chemistry, for advice on how to approach her supervisor. Chloe suggested, ""Tell your supervisor that a well-known biology professor has invited you to join his research group. Your supervisor wouldn't want to lose you and might raise your salary."" Following Chloe's advice, Layla told her supervisor that she had another job offer and would leave unless she received a pay increase. The supervisor suspected Layla might not be truthful, so he said he'd consider it. Later, at an academic seminar, the supervisor encountered the biology professor Layla mentioned and casually asked if he'd offered Layla a position. The professor replied that he had not made any job offer to Layla. After this conversation, Layla's supervisor wondered if Layla had created this lie independently or if someone else had encouraged her to fabricate the story. He generally respected Layla's work ethic, so the supervisor considered whether an external influence might have prompted this deception. The next day, the supervisor informed Layla that he would not increase her salary and she could accept the other position if she wished. Layla later told Chloe what had occurred, and the two sat together, disappointed their strategy had failed.

12. Rabbit vs GuineaPig,"Jake and Maya have an ongoing, silent disagreement about whether to adopt a rabbit or a guinea pig. Maya frequently visits her friend Elena, who has an adorable rabbit Maya loves to cuddle. However, Jake usually avoids tagging along to Elena's, making Maya suspect that Jake isn't keen on rabbits.

13. Lantern Logic & MetaBelief Impossibility,"At the renowned Beijing Opera House, performers are rehearsing the evening's performance of ""Legend of the White Snake."" Li Wei, portraying Xu Xian, is discussing a challenging martial arts scene with Chen Yu (portraying Fa Hai) when they observe new lantern decorations being hung on stage. Their colleague, Jia Lin (portraying Bai Suzhen), has personally designed and added intricate lotus patterns to these lanterns, which were not part of the original staging plan. Another performer, Ming Tao (portraying Xiao Qing), is delayed and has not yet arrived for rehearsal.

Li Wei briefly leaves to adjust his elaborate costume. Meanwhile, Chen Yu examines Jia Lin's new lantern arrangements closely. Concerned about safety for the acrobatic routines, Chen Yu subtly rearranges several lanterns. Jia Lin notices Chen Yu's actions through a backstage mirror but pretends she hasn't seen, assuming Chen Yu's actions reflect the director's orders, though Chen Yu is acting solely out of safety concerns.

Worried about Chen Yu's changes, Jia Lin quietly returns some lanterns to their original positions while adding hidden safety reinforcements invisible to the audience. She makes these adjustments while Chen Yu practices elsewhere. To avoid any conflict, Jia Lin then replaces some of the original lanterns entirely with stronger, identical-looking replicas. Neither Li Wei nor Chen Yu observes these final changes.

When Ming Tao finally arrives, he overhears Jia Lin inform Li Wei, ""I saw Chen Yu moving the lanterns around. She probably thinks they're still arranged according to the original design.""
