                    <h3>Understanding Model 'Cognition'</h3>
                    <p>Humans exhibit cognitive biases and predictable failure modes; AI systems similarly display such patterns. My investigations into human apophenia (false pattern detection) inform targeted strategies to mitigate AI hallucinations, ensuring systems verify rather than merely detect patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Human-Compatible Design</h3>
                    <p>AI systems must interface naturally with human psychology. However, with increased social cognitive abilities comes increased risk of manipulation and deception. My research on this phenomenon in humans provides crucial insights for ensuring AI systems can cooperate effectively while avoiding socially disruptive patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Rigorous Trait Evaluation</h3>
                    <p>Effectively assessing AI behaviors like honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness requires nuanced psychometric frameworks. My expertise in personality and behavioral assessment provides the tools needed for evaluating these complex traits beyond superficial metrics.</p>

                <h3>Vision for Model Behavior</h3>
                <p>Where others see only technical hurdles, I identify cognitive analogies informed by decades of psychological research. This unique vantage point is indispensable for creating AI systems aligned deeply and reliably with human values.</p>
